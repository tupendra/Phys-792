# List of interaction of alpha, beta and gamma particles in air.
#### Here are the list of interaction of alpha particles with ai
- ionIoni
Alpha particles are the positively charged particles which is equvalent to helium nucleus. They interact with air and and cause ionization of air.
- msc	
They can undergo multiple scaterring until all the energy is lost.
- hadElastic 
Alpha particles can elastically scatter agaist a nucleus without changing the direction
- alphaInelastic
Alpha particles can inelastically scatter agianst the nuclues and changes its direction.

#### Here are the list of beta particles with air
- eBrem
When electrons are decelerated at the vicinity of nucleus, a radiation called bremsstrahlung radiation is emitted.
- annihil
Beta particles can interact with positrons and  get annihalted producing two gamma radiations.
- eIon
High energy beta particles can interact with atom and kncock more electrons


#### Here are the list of gamma interaction with air

- phot 
The gamma particles interact with atom and kock the electon out called photoelectric effect. Usually lower energy (~ 0.1 MeV) gamma shows this interaction
- compt
If the gamma has higher energy then it can knock out electrons and scatter with reduced energy which can again knockout another electron and so on.
- Rayl
 Elastic interaction of photons by the charge particles.
